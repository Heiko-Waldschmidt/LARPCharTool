# LARPCharTool
A tool for managing your LARP (Live Action Roleplay) characters.

Current features:
- You can add your characters, conventions and the vists of conventions to a database. -> no Excel Conlist anymore.
  - via WebUI
  - into a SQL-Database.
  - Integrates H2's UI if you want to look directly into the database.

If you are not a programmer and want to test the tool you need to do the following:
0. Requirements: You need Java Runtime Version 8 installed. You need a Browser - I only tested it with Chrome.
1. Download the jar-File
2. execute: java -jar "jarfilename"
3. open your browser
4. open localhost:8080 in your browser.
 
The Datetime Elements are not working in some Browser because they don't have implemented this HTML5 Elements.
