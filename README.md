# LARPCharTool
A tool for managing your LARP (Live Action Roleplay) characters.

Current features:
- You can add your characters, conventions and the vists of conventions to a database. -> no Excel Conlist anymore.
  - via WebUI
  - into a SQL-Database.
  - Integrates H2's UI if you want to look directly into the database.

If you are not a programmer and want to test the tool you need to do the following:

1. Requirements: You need Java Runtime Version 8 installed. You need a Browser (I only tested the tool with Chrome).
2. Download the jar-File
3. execute: java -jar "jarfilename"
4. open your browser
5. open localhost:8080 in your browser.
 
Some time values are not working in some Browsers because they don't have implemented the HTML5 Datetime Element.
